On Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, signals are software interrupts.
They provide a way for the user (or a process) to directly communicate with a process


Software may be programmed to respond intelligently to a wide array of signals, and certain signals cause processes to behave in a standardized, predefined way at the kernel level.

When a signal is sent to a process, the operating system interrupts the normal flow of the process execution and delivers the notification. If the process has previously registered a way to handle that particular signal, that routine is executed, otherwise the system executes the default signal handler.
